Things I did today 15 February 2024

1. Went to uni for IS Tutorial Didn't follow much in the session but was trying

2. Read the TP brief and the document that I made for the requirements in this last submission and Tried to figure out if there is something else that I am missing. Also figuring out what I want to do for this last submission.


3. Made notes for HCI in Unit 4 KE and KE Reflection that are in Google Drive

4. Made a Task 1 submission KE report in Google Drive of Notes about the brief that outlines what we need to do and also a section where I write down in my own words what I understand from it and so that I know what is happening and what we need to do clearly for this assessment.
